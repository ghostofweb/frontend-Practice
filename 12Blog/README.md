# Blog 
these are the dependencies which im using 

@reduxjs/toolkit
react-redux 
react-router-dom
appwrite 
@tinymce/tinymce-react 
html-react-parser 
react-hook-form

!imp, every bundling framework have their ways to impliment .env files, nextjs have different, craete-react have different etc

in Vite, we need

`import.meta.env.VITE_ANYAPP_NAME` 

here we create a diffrent file config.js where we can put all the env files at one place in object

# backend using 3rd party

like firebase or appwrite, for auth and other functions we can create class consisting all the methods which we will need,
so we can create new objects and use them
in config.js

# Database, file Upload and custome queries
